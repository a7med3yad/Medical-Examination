# Medical Examination Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a medical examination dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and derive insights that could be useful in understanding health-related patterns and trends. The dataset contains various health metrics, which will be examined to identify relationships between different variables and potential health outcomes.

## Introduction
This project focuses on examining medical data to identify important patterns and trends related to health conditions. It uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean the data, perform EDA, and visualize key metrics. By the end of the project, you will have a clearer understanding of how different health factors influence medical outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of medical examination records, containing information such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Heart disease indicators
- Other medical metrics

The dataset is publicly available (link to dataset, if applicable), and it can be downloaded for analysis.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install them using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
